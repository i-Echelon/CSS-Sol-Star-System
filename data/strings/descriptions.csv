sol_Sol,CUSTOM,"The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star and the gravitational anchor of our Solar System. This massive fusion reactor converts 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium every second, radiating energy that sustains all planetary climates and weather systems. Solar flares and coronal mass ejections regularly blast charged particles across the system, creating auroras on planets with magnetic fields and posing hazards to spacecraft and communications. The Sun's solar wind extends far beyond Pluto's orbit, creating a protective heliosphere that shields the entire system from most interstellar radiation. Currently middle-aged at 4.6 billion years, the Sun will continue burning hydrogen for another 5 billion years before beginning its transformation into a red giant.","The Life-Giver","Deep within the Sun's core, temperatures reach 15 million degrees Celsius and pressures exceed 250 billion atmospheres. Here, the fundamental forces of the universe forge helium from hydrogen through nuclear fusion, releasing the energy that will take 100,000 years to reach the surface and then just 8 minutes to travel to Earth. When the Sun eventually exhausts its hydrogen fuel, it will expand into a red giant star, engulfing Mercury and Venus and boiling away Earth's oceans before finally shedding its outer layers to become a white dwarf.",,,
sol_Mercury,CUSTOM,"Mercury is the smallest planet and closest to the Sun, a world of extreme contrasts and ancient scars. With no substantial atmosphere to retain heat, surface temperatures swing from 430°C in direct sunlight to -170°C in shadow - the most extreme temperature variation of any planet. This cratered world completes an orbit in just 88 Earth days but rotates so slowly that a single day lasts 176 Earth days. Mercury's disproportionately large iron core makes up 75% of its radius, suggesting it may be the remnant of a much larger world that suffered a catastrophic collision early in Solar System history. Despite its proximity to the Sun, radar observations have detected water ice in permanently shadowed polar craters.","The Scorched World","Mercury's surface tells the violent story of the early Solar System, when massive asteroids and comets regularly bombarded the inner worlds. The Caloris Basin, over 1,500 kilometers across, was carved by an impact so powerful it created hills and ridges on the opposite side of the planet. Ancient lava flows have filled many impact craters, while cliff-like scarps hundreds of kilometers long suggest the planet shrank as its large iron core cooled. In the eternal darkness of its polar craters, spacecraft have found patches of water ice - a precious resource for any future missions to this scorched world.",,,
sol_Venus,CUSTOM,"Venus is Earth's evil twin - nearly identical in size and mass but transformed into a hellish greenhouse world. Its dense carbon dioxide atmosphere creates surface pressures 92 times greater than Earth's, while sulfuric acid clouds completely shroud the planet in a permanent haze. The runaway greenhouse effect maintains surface temperatures of 462°C - hot enough to melt lead and hotter than Mercury despite being twice as far from the Sun. Venus rotates backwards compared to most planets, and so slowly that its day (243 Earth days) is longer than its year (225 Earth days). Soviet Venera landers that reached the surface in the 1970s and 80s were crushed and corroded within hours, but not before sending back images of a rocky, volcanic landscape.","Hell's Twin","Beneath its crushing atmosphere, Venus reveals a world of massive volcanoes and twisted terrain. Radar mapping has identified over 1,000 impact craters, vast volcanic plains, and mountain ranges pushed up by intense geological forces. Maxwell Montes rises 10.8 kilometers above the mean surface - higher than Earth's Mount Everest. Some scientists theorize that Venus may still be volcanically active, with recent evidence suggesting possible ongoing eruptions. The planet's lack of water and plate tectonics means its surface features are preserved for hundreds of millions of years, creating a museum of planetary geology frozen in time beneath that deadly sky.",,,
sol_Earth,CUSTOM,"Earth is the blue marble, the only known world harboring life in a universe that may be teeming with it. Seventy percent of its surface lies beneath dynamic oceans that drive weather patterns and regulate global climate through massive circulation systems. A molten iron core generates Earth's protective magnetic field, deflecting most solar radiation and cosmic rays that would otherwise strip away the atmosphere. Plate tectonics continuously reshape the surface, recycling carbon and nutrients while building mountain ranges and ocean basins. Earth's large moon stabilizes its 23.5-degree axial tilt, preventing chaotic climate swings and enabling the stable seasons that allowed complex life to evolve. From this pale blue dot, humanity first gazed at the stars and began the journey that would carry life itself into the cosmos.","The Blue Marble","Earth's story is one of constant change and remarkable resilience. Over 4.5 billion years, this world has survived massive asteroid impacts, ice ages, volcanic catastrophes, and mass extinctions, each time recovering and diversifying into new forms of life. The atmosphere has been transformed multiple times - first by volcanic outgassing, then by oxygen-producing cyanobacteria, and now by human industrial activity. Beneath the oceans, mid-ocean ridges create new seafloor while subduction zones recycle old crust, driving the continental drift that has assembled and scattered supercontinents throughout geological time. Today, Earth hosts an estimated 8.7 million species, from microscopic bacteria thriving in deep-sea hydrothermal vents to blue whales cruising through polar waters.",,,
sol_Mars,CUSTOM,"Mars is the Red Planet, a cold desert world that may once have been warm and wet enough to support life. Iron oxide dust gives it the characteristic rusty color visible from Earth, while massive geological features dwarf anything on our home world. Olympus Mons stands 21 kilometers tall - nearly three times the height of Mount Everest - while the Valles Marineris canyon system stretches 4,000 kilometers across the planet's equator. Ancient riverbeds, lake beds, and mineral deposits suggest Mars once had a thick atmosphere and flowing water, but today only thin carbon dioxide surrounds this frozen world. Polar ice caps contain both water and frozen carbon dioxide, expanding and contracting with the seasons. Recent discoveries of liquid water beneath the surface and seasonal methane emissions hint that Mars may still harbor microbial life.","The Frontier World","Mars holds the keys to understanding planetary evolution and the potential for life beyond Earth. Robotic explorers have revealed a world shaped by volcanism, impacts, and flowing water over billions of years. The northern lowlands may once have held an ocean covering a third of the planet, while the southern highlands preserve impact craters from the Solar System's violent youth. Dust storms can engulf the entire planet for months, while the thin atmosphere allows meteorites to reach the surface relatively intact - some carrying samples from Mars that were blasted into space and eventually fell to Earth. Future human missions will seek signs of past or present life in subsurface aquifers, polar ice deposits, and the mineral-rich deposits left by ancient hot springs.",,,
sol_Jupiter,CUSTOM,"Jupiter is the king of planets, a gas giant so massive it contains more matter than all other planets combined. This world of perpetual storms radiates more heat than it receives from the Sun, powered by gradual gravitational compression that may have once nearly ignited it as a second star. The Great Red Spot - a hurricane larger than Earth that has raged for at least 400 years - is just the most famous of countless atmospheric phenomena swirling through bands of hydrogen and helium at speeds exceeding 500 kilometers per hour. Jupiter's immense magnetosphere traps charged particles in radiation belts deadly to spacecraft, while gravitational resonances with its moons create gaps in Saturn's rings and deflect asteroids throughout the Solar System. With at least 95 confirmed moons, Jupiter rules a miniature solar system featuring volcanic Io, ice-covered Europa, massive Ganymede, and ancient Callisto.","The Storm King","Jupiter's role as the Solar System's guardian cannot be overstated - its powerful gravity has swept up countless asteroids and comets that might otherwise have threatened the inner planets. The planet's composition closely matches that of the Sun, and some theories suggest it formed by directly capturing gas from the solar nebula rather than growing from a solid core. Deep beneath its colorful cloud layers, pressure and temperature increase until hydrogen becomes metallic, conducting electricity and generating the planet's powerful magnetic field. The Galilean moons offer diverse worlds for exploration: Io's sulfur volcanoes powered by tidal heating, Europa's subsurface ocean that may harbor life, Ganymede with its own magnetic field, and heavily cratered Callisto that preserves a record of the early Solar System.",,,
sol_Saturn,CUSTOM,"Saturn is the ringed jewel of the Solar System, a gas giant adorned with the most spectacular ring system known to science. Composed of countless particles of ice and rock ranging from dust grains to house-sized boulders, the rings span nearly 300,000 kilometers but are typically less than one kilometer thick. Saturn itself is less dense than water and spins so rapidly that it bulges noticeably at the equator. Winds in its atmosphere reach 1,800 kilometers per hour, while hexagonal cloud patterns at the north pole create geometric shapes unique in the Solar System. The planet's 146 confirmed moons include Titan - larger than Mercury and cloaked in a thick nitrogen atmosphere - and Enceladus, which sprays geysers of water ice from its south pole. Saturn's gravitational influence and ring particles create a complex dance of orbital resonances that sculpt gaps, spokes, and braided structures throughout its ring system.","The Ringed Jewel","Saturn's rings are a cosmic laboratory for understanding planetary formation, gravity, and orbital mechanics. The main rings are named alphabetically in order of discovery (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) and contain features like the Cassini Division - a gap carved by gravitational resonances with the moon Mimas. Ring particles constantly collide, break apart, and stick together, while tiny shepherd moons maintain sharp edges through gravitational herding. Titan, Saturn's largest moon, possesses lakes and rivers of liquid methane in a landscape eerily reminiscent of early Earth, complete with weather patterns and seasonal changes. Enceladus may harbor a global ocean beneath its icy crust, making it one of the most promising places to search for extraterrestrial life in our Solar System.",,,
sol_Uranus,CUSTOM,"Uranus is the tilted ice giant, rolling through its orbit on its side with an axial tilt of 98 degrees that creates the most extreme seasons in the Solar System. Each pole experiences 42 years of continuous sunlight followed by 42 years of darkness as the planet completes its 84-year orbit around the Sun. Composed primarily of water, methane, and ammonia ices surrounding a rocky core, Uranus appears as a featureless blue-green disk due to methane in its atmosphere absorbing red light. The planet has 27 known moons and a faint ring system discovered in 1977. Its unusual tilt may result from a collision with an Earth-sized object early in Solar System history, and its weak magnetic field is tilted 59 degrees from its rotational axis, suggesting a complex interior structure. Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to visit this distant world, flying by in 1986 and revealing a planet far stranger than anyone had imagined.","The Tilted Giant","Uranus challenges our understanding of planetary formation and evolution with its bizarre characteristics and mysterious interior. Unlike Jupiter and Saturn, which radiate more heat than they receive, Uranus emits almost no excess heat, suggesting either a different formation process or some catastrophic event that disrupted its internal heat source. The planet's moons include Miranda - a small world with some of the most varied and extreme terrain in the Solar System, suggesting it was shattered and reformed multiple times. Uranus's rings are dark and narrow, composed of organic compounds darkened by radiation, and several were discovered to have shepherd moons maintaining their structure. The planet's strange magnetic field may indicate an unusual interior with a liquid mantle of water, methane, and ammonia surrounding a small rocky core.",,,
sol_Neptune,CUSTOM,"Neptune is the windiest world in the Solar System, where methane clouds race through the atmosphere at speeds exceeding 2,000 kilometers per hour - faster than the speed of sound on Earth. This deep blue ice giant radiates 2.6 times more energy than it receives from the Sun, driving dynamic weather patterns at the edge of the Solar System where sunlight is 1,000 times weaker than at Earth. The Great Dark Spot observed by Voyager 2 was a storm system larger than Jupiter's Great Red Spot, though it had vanished when the Hubble Space Telescope observed Neptune years later. With 16 known moons, Neptune's system is dominated by Triton - a captured Kuiper Belt object that orbits backwards and may have disrupted any original moon system. Neptune's gravity shapes the outer Solar System, controlling the orbits of Kuiper Belt objects and Pluto through complex gravitational resonances.","The Windswept Edge","Neptune represents the frontier of our Solar System's major planets, a world where extreme conditions create phenomena impossible on the inner worlds. Triton, Neptune's largest moon, is one of the coldest objects in the Solar System yet shows signs of geological activity, with nitrogen geysers erupting from its south pole. This retrograde moon is slowly spiraling inward and will eventually be torn apart by Neptune's gravity, creating a ring system that may rival Saturn's. The planet's deep blue color comes from methane in its atmosphere, while its core may reach temperatures of 5,000°C - as hot as the Sun's surface. Neptune's discovery in 1846 represented a triumph of mathematical astronomy, found exactly where calculations predicted it should be based on perturbations in Uranus's orbit.",,,
sol_Ceres,CUSTOM,"Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt and the closest dwarf planet to Earth, a world that bridges the gap between asteroid and planet. Nearly 1,000 kilometers in diameter, Ceres contains about one-third of the asteroid belt's total mass and may harbor more fresh water beneath its surface than exists in all of Earth's freshwater lakes and rivers. The Dawn spacecraft revealed a complex world with bright spots in Occator crater that are deposits of sodium carbonate left by briny water that seeped up from the interior. Evidence suggests Ceres has a differentiated interior with a rocky core, water-ice mantle, and thin, dusty crust, making it more like the icy moons of the outer Solar System than a typical asteroid. Seasonal changes in water vapor emissions and possible cryovolcanic activity hint that this small world may still be geologically active.","The Water Bearer","Ceres offers a window into the early Solar System when the line between asteroids, comets, and planets was less clearly defined. Its surface shows signs of impact cratering, but also smooth plains that suggest geological resurfacing. The bright deposits in Occator crater formed when subsurface brines containing dissolved salts reached the surface and left mineral deposits as the water sublimated into space. Some scientists speculate that Ceres's subsurface ocean could potentially harbor microbial life, protected from radiation by its rocky crust and kept liquid by radioactive decay in its core. As a dwarf planet, Ceres represents what planets might have looked like in their early stages of formation, before gravitational clearing created the distinct separation between planets and smaller bodies we see today.",,,
sol_Pluto,CUSTOM,"Pluto is a complex dwarf planet at the frontier of the Kuiper Belt, a world that defied expectations when New Horizons flew by in 2015. Far from being a simple frozen iceball, Pluto displays active geology with nitrogen glaciers flowing across vast plains, water-ice mountains rising 3.5 kilometers high, and a thin atmosphere of nitrogen that expands and contracts as the planet's elliptical orbit carries it closer to and farther from the Sun. Pluto and its largest moon Charon form a binary system, tidally locked so they always show the same faces to each other. The reclassification from planet to dwarf planet in 2006 sparked controversy, but Pluto's scientific importance has only grown with each new discovery about this distant world and its place in the outer Solar System's complex architecture.","The Distant Heart","Pluto's surface reveals a world of surprising complexity and beauty, with vast plains of frozen nitrogen punctuated by dark, organic compounds that give regions like Cthulhu Macula their distinctive coloration. The heart-shaped feature informally named Tombaugh Regio contains Sputnik Planitia, a glacier of nitrogen ice that appears to be actively flowing and recycling its surface. Pluto's thin atmosphere may contain organic haze similar to that on Saturn's moon Titan, created when solar ultraviolet light breaks down methane molecules. The dwarf planet's five known moons, including large Charon and tiny, rapidly spinning Nix and Hydra, may have formed from debris left over from a giant impact early in Pluto's history. As humanity's most distant planetary encounter, Pluto continues to surprise scientists and expand our understanding of the outer Solar System's diversity.",,,
sol_Luna,CUSTOM,"Luna, Earth's Moon, is far more than just a satellite - it's Earth's cosmic partner and humanity's stepping stone to the stars. Formed 4.5 billion years ago likely from debris created when a Mars-sized object collided with early Earth, the Moon has been gradually moving away from our planet ever since, currently receding at 3.8 centimeters per year. Tidally locked in synchronous rotation, Luna always shows the same face to Earth, with the far side remaining hidden until spacecraft revealed its heavily cratered landscape in 1959. The Moon's gravitational pull creates Earth's tides, stabilizes our planet's axial tilt, and gradually slows Earth's rotation. Luna's surface preserves a 4-billion-year record of impacts that Earth's active geology has long since erased, making it a museum of early Solar System history and the target of humanity's first steps beyond our home world.","Earth's Guardian","Luna's surface tells the story of the Solar System's violent youth through its maria (dark volcanic plains) and highlands (bright, heavily cratered terrain). The Moon's interior likely contains a small iron core, rocky mantle, and thin crust, with moonquakes still occurring due to tidal forces and thermal expansion. Water ice has been confirmed in permanently shadowed polar craters, deposited by comets and asteroids over billions of years and preserved in the eternal cold. The Apollo missions brought back 842 pounds of lunar samples that revolutionized our understanding of planetary formation, while ongoing robotic missions from multiple nations continue to explore Luna's resources and potential as a base for deeper space exploration. As Earth's constant companion, the Moon serves as both our shared human heritage and the gateway to becoming a spacefaring civilization.",,,
sol_Phobos,CUSTOM,"Phobos is Mars's larger and inner moon, a potato-shaped chunk of rock just 22 kilometers across that races around the Red Planet in less than 8 hours - faster than Mars rotates. This doomed satellite is slowly spiraling inward due to tidal forces, losing about 1.8 centimeters of altitude per century and destined to either crash into Mars or be torn apart into a ring system within 50 million years. Phobos is one of the darkest objects in the Solar System, reflecting only 6% of sunlight, and is likely a captured asteroid from the outer asteroid belt. Strange parallel grooves across its surface may be stress fractures caused by tidal forces or chains of craters from debris blasted off Mars by impacts. Despite its small size and irregular shape, Phobos experiences Martian eclipses and transits that have been observed by rovers on the surface below.","The Doomed Rock","Phobos represents both the violent history of the inner Solar System and a potential resource for future Mars exploration. Its composition appears similar to D-type asteroids found in the outer asteroid belt, supporting theories that it migrated inward over millions of years before being captured by Mars's gravity. The moon's largest crater, Stickney, is nearly half the diameter of Phobos itself and was likely caused by an impact that nearly shattered the small world. Future missions may use Phobos as a staging area for Mars exploration, taking advantage of its weak gravity (about 1/1000th of Earth's) to easily land and launch spacecraft while still providing access to the Martian system. The grooves and ridges covering much of Phobos's surface remain mysterious, possibly created by the same impact that formed Stickney crater or by ongoing tidal stress as the moon is slowly torn apart by Mars's gravity.",,,
sol_Deimos,CUSTOM,"Deimos is the smaller and more distant of Mars's two moons, a dark, irregularly shaped rock about 12 kilometers across that orbits beyond the synchronous orbit distance. Unlike its inward-spiraling companion Phobos, Deimos is slowly drifting away from Mars and may eventually escape the planet's gravitational influence entirely. This tiny moon takes 30 hours to complete one orbit, meaning it rises in the east and sets in the west as seen from Mars, but so slowly that it remains visible in the Martian sky for over two days at a time. Deimos has a smoother appearance than Phobos, covered in a thick layer of regolith that fills in craters and gives it a more rounded profile. Like Phobos, it's probably a captured asteroid, possibly originating from the same parent body that was broken apart by a collision in the outer asteroid belt.", "The Drifting Stone","Deimos offers a unique vantage point for observing Mars and the inner Solar System, orbiting at a distance where Mars appears about twice the size of our Moon as seen from Earth. The regolith covering Deimos is unusually fine and deep, possibly indicating it has been in the Mars system longer than Phobos and has accumulated more micrometeorite impacts and dust. Some of this material may actually be dust blown off Mars by impact events or dust storms, making Deimos a repository of Martian surface samples that could be easier to access than landing on Mars itself. The moon's weak gravity and stable orbit make it an attractive target for future robotic missions that could serve as communication relays for Mars surface operations or as fuel depots for interplanetary spacecraft using resources extracted from its surface materials.",,,
sol_Io,CUSTOM,"Io is a world on fire, the most volcanically active body in the Solar System with over 400 active volcanoes powered by the immense tidal forces of Jupiter's gravity. As Io orbits through Jupiter's magnetosphere every 42 hours, it experiences constant stretching and flexing that generates enough internal heat to melt rock and drive continuous eruptions. Sulfur and sulfur dioxide paint Io's surface in brilliant yellows, oranges, and whites, while volcanic plumes can tower 500 kilometers above the surface - high enough to be seen from Earth-based telescopes. The moon has no water and virtually no impact craters, as its surface is completely resurfaced by volcanic activity every few thousand years. Io's thin atmosphere consists mainly of sulfur dioxide gas from volcanic outgassing, and its volcanoes pump out more heat per unit area than any other solid body in the Solar System.","The Volcanic Hell","Io exists in a state of perpetual geological violence, with some volcanoes producing eruptions hot enough to melt silicate rock - temperatures not seen on Earth for billions of years. The tidal heating that drives this activity comes from Io's orbital resonance with Europa and Ganymede, which prevents its orbit from becoming circular and maintains the gravitational stress that flexes the moon's interior. Io's volcanoes come in different types: some produce towering plumes of sulfur dioxide gas and dust, while others create vast lava lakes and flows of molten sulfur. The moon acts as a massive electrical generator as it moves through Jupiter's magnetic field, creating electrical currents that flow between Io and Jupiter's upper atmosphere. This hellish world provides insights into the early volcanic activity that shaped all rocky planets, preserved in an environment where tidal forces maintain conditions long since extinct elsewhere in the Solar System.",,,
sol_Europa,CUSTOM,"Europa is one of the Solar System's most intriguing worlds, hiding a vast global ocean beneath its smooth, icy crust that may contain twice as much water as all of Earth's oceans combined. This Jovian moon's surface is among the youngest in the Solar System, constantly renewed by geological processes that create a complex network of ridges, cracks, and chaotic terrain where the ice shell has been broken apart and reformed. Tidal heating from Jupiter's gravity keeps Europa's subsurface ocean liquid despite the moon's distance from the Sun, while the same forces may drive hydrothermal activity on the ocean floor similar to the deep-sea vents that support unique ecosystems on Earth. Europa's thin oxygen atmosphere is created when Jupiter's radiation splits water molecules on the surface, and recent observations suggest water vapor plumes may occasionally erupt from the south polar region, providing potential access to the hidden ocean below.","The Hidden Ocean","Europa represents one of the most promising locations to search for extraterrestrial life in our Solar System. The moon's subsurface ocean is in direct contact with a rocky mantle, potentially creating the chemical interactions necessary for life as we know it. The constant flexing of Europa's interior by Jupiter's tidal forces may drive hydrothermal circulation that could provide energy for biological processes, while the ocean's long-term stability over billions of years would have allowed time for life to evolve. The icy crust acts as a protective barrier against Jupiter's deadly radiation while potentially allowing chemical exchange between the surface and ocean through cracks and upwelling. Future missions plan to orbit Europa and possibly land on its surface to sample the ice and search for biosignatures, while more ambitious concepts envision robotic submarines that could penetrate the ice shell and explore the hidden ocean directly.",,,
sol_Ganymede,CUSTOM,"Ganymede is the largest moon in the Solar System, bigger than Mercury and the only moon known to generate its own magnetic field through a partially molten iron core. This massive Jovian satellite shows clear evidence of geological activity in its grooved terrain, where the icy crust has been stretched and fractured to create parallel ridges and valleys spanning hundreds of kilometers. Ganymede's surface is divided between dark, heavily cratered regions billions of years old and brighter grooved terrain that may be only a few hundred million years old. Beneath its icy surface lies a subsurface ocean that may contain more water than all of Earth's surface water, sandwiched between layers of different types of ice under extreme pressure. The Hubble Space Telescope has detected aurora at Ganymede's poles, created by charged particles interacting with its magnetic field - the first auroral activity ever observed on a moon.","The Magnetic Giant","Ganymede's unique magnetic field creates a magnetosphere within Jupiter's much larger magnetic field, providing some protection from radiation and creating complex interactions between the two magnetic systems. The moon's internal structure likely consists of a metallic core, rocky mantle, and multiple layers of water and ice, making it more like a small planet than a typical moon. The grooved terrain suggests that Ganymede experienced a period of intense geological activity that fractured and rebuilt large portions of its surface, possibly triggered by orbital resonances or internal heating. Recent studies suggest that Ganymede's subsurface ocean may be stratified into multiple layers with different compositions, potentially including layers of exotic high-pressure ice phases not found anywhere else. As the target of ESA's JUICE mission arriving in the 2030s, Ganymede will be the first moon to be orbited by a spacecraft from another world, providing unprecedented insights into this complex and fascinating world.",,,
sol_Callisto,CUSTOM,"Callisto is Jupiter's most distant major moon and one of the most heavily cratered objects in the Solar System, its ancient surface preserving a 4-billion-year record of impacts from the early Solar System's chaotic period. Unlike its neighboring moons, Callisto shows little evidence of geological activity and may never have been fully differentiated, with rock and ice mixed throughout its interior rather than separated into distinct layers. Despite its battered appearance, Callisto likely harbors a subsurface ocean beneath its icy crust, though this ocean is probably sandwiched between layers of ice and may not contact the rocky interior directly. The moon's dark surface reflects only 20% of sunlight, colored by organic compounds and dust accumulated over billions of years. Callisto's distance from Jupiter places it outside the planet's most intense radiation belts, making it a potentially safer target for future human exploration than the inner Galilean moons.","The Ancient Witness","Callisto serves as a time capsule of the early Solar System, its heavily cratered surface telling the story of the Late Heavy Bombardment that battered all the inner worlds around 4 billion years ago. The largest impact feature, Valhalla, is a multi-ring basin over 4,000 kilometers across - evidence of a massive collision that would have reshaped the moon's interior structure. Unlike Europa and Ganymede, Callisto's subsurface ocean may be isolated from its rocky interior by layers of high-pressure ice, potentially limiting the chemical interactions necessary for life. However, the moon's stable environment and distance from Jupiter's radiation make it an attractive location for a future base to support exploration of the Jovian system. Callisto's low density suggests it formed from a mixture of rock and ice that was never heated enough to separate completely, providing insights into the conditions present during the formation of the outer Solar System's moons and small bodies.",,,
sol_Enceladus,CUSTOM,"Enceladus is a small, brilliant moon of Saturn that has revolutionized our understanding of where life might exist in the outer Solar System. Despite being only 500 kilometers in diameter, this icy world generates spectacular geysers of water vapor, organic compounds, and ice crystals that erupt from warm fractures near its south pole at speeds up to 2,100 kilometers per hour. These plumes feed Saturn's E-ring and provide direct access to a global subsurface ocean that lies beneath 30-40 kilometers of ice. Tidal heating from Saturn's gravity keeps this ocean liquid and may drive hydrothermal activity on the ocean floor, creating environments similar to the deep-sea hydrothermal vents on Earth where life may have first evolved. The smooth, bright surface of Enceladus reflects nearly 100% of sunlight, making it one of the most reflective objects in the Solar System.","The Ice Geyser","Enceladus has become one of the highest-priority targets in the search for extraterrestrial life after the Cassini spacecraft detected not just water vapor in its plumes, but also organic molecules, silicate particles, and hydrogen gas that suggest hydrothermal activity on the ocean floor. The moon's tiger stripe fractures at the south pole are warmer than the surrounding terrain and show evidence of recent geological activity, with some areas reaching temperatures as high as -80°C despite being far from the Sun. The global ocean beneath Enceladus's ice shell may be 10 kilometers deep and in contact with a rocky core, providing the water-rock interactions that could generate the chemical energy necessary for life. Future missions are being designed to fly through the plumes and analyze their composition in greater detail, while more ambitious concepts would land near the tiger stripes or even attempt to melt through the ice to explore the ocean directly.",,,
sol_Titan,CUSTOM,"Titan is Saturn's largest moon and the only moon in the Solar System with a substantial atmosphere, cloaked in a thick haze of nitrogen and methane that creates weather patterns, seasonal changes, and a hydrological cycle reminiscent of early Earth. Rivers of liquid methane and ethane carve channels across Titan's surface, flowing into vast lakes and seas concentrated near the polar regions. Kraken Mare, the largest of these hydrocarbon seas, is larger than Earth's Caspian Sea and may be several hundred meters deep. Titan's surface pressure is 60% greater than Earth's, and its dense atmosphere would allow humans to fly with simple wing-powered aircraft, though the surface temperature of -179°C would require substantial protection. Beneath its icy crust, Titan likely harbors a subsurface ocean of liquid water that may contain more water than all of Earth's oceans, making it both an analog for early Earth and a potential habitat for life.","The Methane World","Titan represents a unique laboratory for studying prebiotic chemistry and atmospheric evolution under conditions that may resemble early Earth before life arose. The moon's thick atmosphere is constantly producing complex organic molecules through chemical reactions driven by solar ultraviolet light and charged particles from Saturn's magnetosphere. These organic compounds rain down onto the surface, where they accumulate into vast dune fields that cover much of Titan's equatorial regions. The Cassini-Huygens mission revealed a world of startling complexity, with evidence of cryovolcanoes that may erupt water and ammonia, impact craters partially filled with organic sediments, and possible seasonal changes in the distribution of surface liquids. Titan's subsurface ocean is likely salty and may be in contact with a rocky core, while the surface environment provides a natural laboratory for studying the kinds of organic chemistry that may have led to the origin of life on Earth billions of years ago.",,,
sol_Oberon,CUSTOM,"Oberon is the outermost and second-largest moon of Uranus, a dark and ancient world whose heavily cratered surface tells the story of billions of years of cosmic bombardment. With a diameter of 1,523 kilometers, Oberon shows evidence of past geological activity in the form of chasmata - large canyons and scarps that cut across its surface alongside numerous impact craters. The moon's surface is composed of a mixture of water ice and rocky material, darkened by carbonaceous compounds and organic materials that give it a low reflectivity of only 14%. Several of Oberon's craters show bright rays and central peaks, indicating relatively recent impacts that excavated cleaner ice from beneath the darkened surface layer. Like all of Uranus's major moons, Oberon is likely differentiated with a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle, and may harbor a thin subsurface ocean beneath its frozen exterior.","The Dark Sentinel","Oberon's surface features suggest a complex geological history despite its current inactive state. The largest crater, Hamlet, is 206 kilometers across and shows a well-preserved central peak, while several craters have dark floors that may be filled with organic-rich material. The chasmata that cross Oberon's surface, including the prominent Mommur Chasma, may have formed during a period when the moon's interior was still warm enough to drive tectonic activity, possibly billions of years ago. Spectroscopic observations have detected water ice on Oberon's surface, along with possible traces of carbon dioxide ice in the polar regions. The moon's position in Uranus's highly tilted system means it experiences extreme seasonal variations, with each pole spending 42 years in continuous sunlight followed by 42 years of darkness, potentially affecting the stability and distribution of surface ices over long timescales.",,,
sol_Titania,CUSTOM,"Titania is the largest moon of Uranus and one of the most geologically diverse objects in the outer Solar System, with a surface carved by enormous fault systems and canyons that rival anything found on terrestrial planets. The most prominent feature is Messina Chasmata, a canyon system that stretches nearly 1,500 kilometers across Titania's surface - about one-third of the moon's circumference. These massive rifts suggest that Titania experienced significant geological activity in its past, possibly driven by tidal heating when it was in a more eccentric orbit. The moon's surface shows a mixture of heavily cratered terrain and younger, smoother plains that indicate resurfacing events. Spectroscopic analysis reveals a surface composed primarily of water ice mixed with rocky material and organic compounds that darken the overall appearance. At 1,578 kilometers in diameter, Titania is about half the size of Earth's Moon but shows evidence of internal differentiation with a possible subsurface ocean.","The Scarred Titan","Titania's dramatic topography tells a story of internal forces that once reshaped this distant world on a massive scale. The canyon systems may have formed when Titania's interior expanded as radioactive decay heated its core, causing the icy crust to crack and stretch. Some of the largest craters, like Gertrude and Imogen, show well-preserved central peaks and terraced walls, indicating they formed in relatively recent geological time when the surface was still capable of maintaining steep slopes. The presence of CO2 ice has been detected in Titania's polar regions, possibly deposited from its thin exosphere or from impacts by carbon-rich bodies. Like other Uranian moons, Titania's extreme seasons mean that surface temperatures and ice stability vary dramatically over its 84-year orbital period around the Sun, potentially driving ongoing geological processes even today.",,,
sol_Miranda,CUSTOM,"Miranda is the strangest moon in the Solar System, a small world whose surface looks like a cosmic jigsaw puzzle assembled from pieces of different worlds. Only 472 kilometers in diameter, Miranda displays some of the most extreme and varied terrain found anywhere, with towering cliffs, deep canyons, and three large ovoid features called coronae that appear to be regions where the surface has been completely reworked. Verona Rupes, a cliff on Miranda's surface, rises 5-10 kilometers high - nearly 10 times taller than the Grand Canyon is deep. The moon's surface shows evidence of multiple episodes of disruption and reassembly, possibly the result of catastrophic collisions that shattered Miranda and allowed it to re-accrete under its own weak gravity. Despite its small size, Miranda shows clear evidence of past geological activity, with different regions displaying vastly different crater densities and surface ages ranging from ancient to relatively young.","The Broken World","Miranda's bizarre terrain suggests a violent history of destruction and reformation that may have occurred multiple times throughout its existence. The three coronae - Arden, Elsinore, and Inverness - show evidence of internal heating and upwelling that brought warm material to the surface, creating the grooved and ridged terrain within these regions. Computer models suggest that Miranda may have been disrupted by impacts at least five times, each time reassembling into a slightly different configuration. The extreme topography, including cliffs that would take 10 minutes to fall from in Miranda's weak gravity, may have formed during these reassembly processes when large blocks of material settled into new positions. Some scientists propose that tidal heating from Uranus could have provided the energy for Miranda's geological activity during periods when its orbit was more eccentric, potentially explaining how such a small world could generate enough internal heat to drive the extensive resurfacing seen across its surface.",,,
sol_Triton,CUSTOM,"Triton is Neptune's largest moon and one of the most fascinating objects in the outer Solar System, a captured Kuiper Belt object that orbits backward around Neptune and shows clear signs of ongoing geological activity despite its great distance from the Sun. Larger than Pluto and composed of rock and water ice with a thin nitrogen atmosphere, Triton is slowly spiraling inward toward Neptune and will eventually be torn apart by tidal forces in about 3.6 billion years. Its surface features include vast plains of frozen nitrogen, impact craters, and active nitrogen geysers that spray dark material up to 8 kilometers high, deposited by prevailing winds into long, dark streaks across the polar ice cap. Triton's retrograde orbit and high inclination strongly suggest it was once an independent dwarf planet similar to Pluto that was gravitationally captured by Neptune, likely disrupting any original moon system in the process. The moon's pink and blue coloration comes from methane and nitrogen ices on its surface, while its thin atmosphere undergoes seasonal changes as different regions are exposed to sunlight during Neptune's 165-year orbit.","The Captive Wanderer","Triton represents a captured piece of the outer Solar System that provides insights into both Kuiper Belt objects and the early history of Neptune's system. The moon's geological activity is powered by a combination of radioactive decay in its core and tidal heating as its orbit gradually decays, creating internal temperatures warm enough to drive nitrogen volcanism and atmospheric circulation. The cantaloupe terrain near Triton's south pole consists of mysterious pitted and ridged landscape unlike anything seen elsewhere, possibly formed by sublimation and collapse of subsurface nitrogen ice deposits. Triton likely harbors a subsurface ocean beneath its icy crust, kept liquid by the same tidal forces that drive its geological activity. The moon's capture by Neptune would have been a catastrophic event that melted much of its interior and reset its geological clock, explaining why Triton shows signs of recent activity despite being billions of years old. As one of the coldest surfaces in the Solar System at -235°C, Triton preserves volatile compounds that have long since been lost from warmer worlds.",,,
sol_Charon,CUSTOM,"Charon is Pluto's largest moon and binary companion, forming a unique double planet system where both bodies are tidally locked to face each other for eternity. At 1,212 kilometers in diameter, Charon is about half the size of Pluto, making it proportionally the largest moon relative to its parent planet in the Solar System. The Pluto-Charon system orbits around a common center of mass (barycenter) that lies in the space between them rather than inside either body. Charon's surface shows a complex landscape of canyons, plains, and a distinctive dark polar region informally named Mordor Macula. The canyon system near Charon's equator, including Serenity Chasma, stretches over 1,000 kilometers and may have formed when a subsurface ocean froze and expanded, cracking the moon's crust. Unlike Pluto's varied terrain, Charon appears to be geologically inactive today, though evidence suggests it was active in the past when tidal heating from its formation kept its interior warm.","Pluto's Dance Partner","Charon's formation likely resulted from a giant impact that blasted material off Pluto, which then coalesced into the large moon we see today - similar to theories for the formation of Earth's Moon but on a much smaller scale. The dark material covering Charon's north pole may be organic compounds called tholins, created when methane escapes from Pluto's atmosphere, becomes trapped by Charon's weak gravity, and is processed by solar radiation into complex organic molecules. Charon's relatively large size compared to Pluto means that the two bodies exert significant tidal forces on each other, which may have driven early geological activity and helped circularize their orbits over time. The moon's water-ice surface shows signs of past cryovolcanism, where liquid water mixed with ammonia erupted onto the surface before freezing. As part of the Pluto system's slow orbital dance, Charon experiences extreme seasonal variations over Pluto's 248-year orbit, with each hemisphere spending over a century in continuous darkness followed by continuous daylight.",,,
sol_DSN,CUSTOM,"The Deep Space Network (DSN) is humanity's primary communication lifeline to spacecraft exploring the Solar System and beyond, consisting of three massive antenna complexes strategically positioned around Earth to maintain constant contact with deep space missions. Located in California's Mojave Desert, Spain's Madrid region, and Australia's Canberra area, these facilities use dish antennas up to 70 meters in diameter to track spacecraft billions of kilometers away. The DSN can receive signals as weak as 20 billion times fainter than the power required to operate a digital watch, while simultaneously transmitting commands and receiving scientific data from dozens of active missions including the Voyager probes now in interstellar space. Each complex operates 24 hours a day, with Earth's rotation ensuring that at least one station can always communicate with any spacecraft in the Solar System. The network also supports radio astronomy research and serves as a crucial backup for satellite navigation and Earth observation missions.","Humanity's Voice","The DSN represents one of the most sophisticated communication networks ever built, capable of detecting signals from spacecraft at the edge of the Solar System using receivers sensitive enough to detect the energy equivalent of a snowflake hitting the ground. The 70-meter antennas can track multiple spacecraft simultaneously while also conducting radio science experiments that use spacecraft as radio sources to study planetary atmospheres, ring systems, and gravitational fields. The network's precision is extraordinary - it can determine spacecraft positions to within a few meters at distances of billions of kilometers, enabling precise navigation for planetary flybys and orbital insertions. The DSN has been continuously upgraded since the 1960s, with new digital systems and signal processing techniques allowing it to support higher data rates and more complex missions. Without the DSN, missions like Cassini's exploration of Saturn, the Mars rovers' surface operations, and Voyager's journey into interstellar space would be impossible, making it truly humanity's voice across the cosmos.",,,
sol_SSN,CUSTOM,"The Space Surveillance Network (SSN) is a global system of ground-based radars, optical telescopes, and sensors that tracks more than 34,000 objects larger than 10 centimeters in Earth orbit, from active satellites to defunct spacecraft and collision fragments. Operated primarily by the U.S. Space Force, the SSN maintains a catalog of all trackable space objects and their orbital parameters, updating this information thousands of times per day as objects move through their orbits at speeds up to 28,000 kilometers per hour. The network can detect objects as small as a marble in low Earth orbit and basketball-sized debris at geostationary altitude, providing collision warnings to satellite operators and the International Space Station when orbital paths intersect. Major facilities include the Space Fence radar in the Marshall Islands, capable of tracking objects as small as 2 centimeters, and optical telescopes that can observe satellites in high orbits where radar coverage is limited. As space becomes increasingly crowded with new satellite constellations and debris from anti-satellite tests, the SSN has become critical for maintaining safe operations in Earth's orbital environment.","The Silent Watchers","The SSN faces the growing challenge of monitoring an increasingly congested space environment where even tiny pieces of debris pose serious threats to operational spacecraft. A fleck of paint traveling at orbital velocity can damage spacecraft windows, while larger debris can destroy satellites worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The network's sophisticated algorithms predict the future positions of tracked objects and issue collision warnings when two objects are predicted to come within a few kilometers of each other. Recent additions to the SSN include advanced phased-array radars that can track hundreds of objects simultaneously and space-based sensors that provide better coverage of objects in high orbits. The system also monitors satellite breakups, tracking the resulting debris clouds as they spread around Earth and cataloging new fragments that could pose long-term hazards. With commercial space activities expanding rapidly and new spacefaring nations joining the orbital community, the SSN's role in maintaining space situational awareness has become more crucial than ever for protecting the space infrastructure that modern civilization depends on.",,,
sol_ISS,CUSTOM,"The International Space Station (ISS) is humanity's outpost in space, a football field-sized laboratory orbiting Earth every 90 minutes at an altitude of approximately 400 kilometers and a speed of 28,000 kilometers per hour. This remarkable achievement of international cooperation has been continuously crewed since November 2000, hosting astronauts and cosmonauts from 19 different countries who conduct scientific research impossible on Earth's surface. The ISS serves multiple roles: a microgravity research laboratory studying everything from protein crystal growth to combustion physics, an Earth observation platform providing real-time monitoring of natural disasters and climate change, and a technology testbed for systems needed for future deep space exploration. The station's modular design allows it to be continuously upgraded and expanded, with new modules, experiments, and capabilities added regularly. Despite operating in the harsh environment of space with temperature swings from -157°C to +121°C, the ISS has proven remarkably resilient and has exceeded its original 15-year design life.","The Orbital Outpost","The ISS represents humanity's first permanent foothold beyond Earth, demonstrating that humans can live and work in space for extended periods while conducting meaningful scientific research. The station's microgravity environment allows scientists to study fundamental physics, biology, and materials science in ways impossible on Earth, leading to advances in drug development, materials engineering, and our understanding of human physiology in space. The ISS serves as a crucial stepping stone for future deep space missions, providing experience in long-duration spaceflight, life support systems, and international cooperation that will be essential for missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. The station's Earth observation capabilities have provided invaluable data for climate research, disaster response, and environmental monitoring, while its educational outreach programs have inspired millions of students worldwide to pursue careers in science and engineering. As the ISS approaches the end of its operational life in the 2030s, it will be succeeded by commercial space stations that build upon the lessons learned from this remarkable achievement of human ingenuity and international collaboration.",,,
terrestrial,PLANET,"Earth is classified as a terrestrial planet - a small, rocky world with a solid surface composed primarily of silicate rock and metals, in contrast to the gas and ice giants of the outer Solar System. What makes Earth unique among terrestrial planets is its abundance of liquid water, which covers approximately 70% of its surface in vast oceans that drive weather patterns, regulate climate, and provide the medium in which life evolved. Earth's size and composition give it sufficient gravity to retain a substantial atmosphere while maintaining surface conditions that allow water to exist in all three phases - solid, liquid, and gas. The planet's active geology, driven by plate tectonics and a molten iron core, continuously recycles materials and generates the magnetic field that protects the atmosphere from solar wind erosion. Among the terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars), Earth occupies the 'habitable zone' where temperatures allow liquid water to persist on the surface.",,"Earth's terrestrial nature is defined by its differentiated interior structure: a solid inner core and liquid outer core of iron and nickel, surrounded by a rocky mantle of silicate minerals, and topped by a thin crust that forms the continents and ocean floors. This internal structure drives the geological processes that have shaped Earth's surface over 4.5 billion years, from the formation of the earliest continents to the ongoing creation of new oceanic crust at mid-ocean ridges. The interaction between Earth's solid surface, liquid oceans, and gaseous atmosphere creates a complex system of energy and material cycling that maintains relatively stable conditions suitable for life. Earth's status as an 'ocean planet' among the terrestrial worlds makes it unique in the inner Solar System, though similar ocean worlds may exist among the moons of the gas giants, hidden beneath thick shells of ice in the cold outer regions where Earth-like surface conditions are impossible.",,,
sol_RedAlert,CUSTOM,"An abandoned Sub Space Station. How it landed in Mar's orbit, is unknown.","Red-Rock Subspace Engine","In 2372, three officers of the USS Voyager, Ensign Harry Kim, along with Lieutenants Tom Paris and B'Elanna Torres attempted to break the transwarp threshold by running simulations of a shuttlecraft in the ship's holodeck. Ultimately, the test failed when the nacelles were ripped off the shuttle when it accelerated to warp 10. While the three attempted to solve the problem in the mess hall, Neelix, Voyager's morale officer, attempted to help. Paris asked him if he knew anything about quantum warp theory or multispectral subspace engine design. Neelix, however, knew nothing about them.",,,
sol_SiphonStation,CUSTOM,"Once a giant industrial machine that manipulated the magnetosphere of Saturn to pull volatiles into space from the highest reaches of an artificial storm-system, the coils, generators, and tanks are now gutted, the habitats run-through by energy lances. A few hangars and access tunnels still show minimal life-support function, pitifully lingering until inevitable gas leakage and solar cell fouling leaves the station as cold and dead as the tomb it is.","Titan's Eye","Siphons rely on gravity and atmospheric pressure.
